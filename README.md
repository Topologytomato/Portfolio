# What is it?
It is a Portfolio repository with writing sample, coding sample and the portfolio file. The skills and technologies used in the projects are mainly related to regression analysis, data visualization, and data processing. There are also a few projects about Machine Learning/AI.

# Writing Sample
It is an analysis report about Airbnb data in Boston and Hawaii. The report aims to analyze the factors that may affect the price of houses or rooms on Airbnb and conduct a multilevel analysis of the prices in different neighbourhoods of Hawaii and Boston.

Data Source: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/

# Coding Sample
## Language used
- Python
- R language

## Function of the scripts:
- Agro_proj.R
  - The script is designed to extract and clean raw data, rendering it suitable for training a Random Forest model. It encompasses data cleaning, geographic information re-projection, data merging, and pixel data retrieval. Additionally, it facilitates the extraction of data from an agricultural public data API.

- UCDS_proj.R
  - The script is designed to clean and visualize the raw data of strawberry from USDA. The main ideal is using the tidyverse package to clean and organize the data.
 
- Mapshinyapp.R
  - The script is designed to draw a map and show the MBTA routes in greater Boston.
